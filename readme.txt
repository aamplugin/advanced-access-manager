= Non-Negotiable =

We take security and privacy very seriously, that is why there are several non-negotiable items that we obey for all cost in the basic AAM version.

* AAM does not create new or alter existing website database tables;
* AAM does not read any files outside of the AAM pluginâ€™s folder;
* AAM does not create new, write or delete any existing files or folders on a server;
* AAM does not capture or send externally any information about how it is used;
* AAM does not capture or send externally any information about a website server. The only exception is a website domain that is assigned to a premium license during activation;
* AAM does not integrate with any other plugins directly;
* AAM does not impersonate or swap user login sessions. All the authentication is handled by WordPress core where AAM may provide only verified and trusted information as means of authentication;
* AAM does not include advertisement of any kind (no banners, cross-sales pitches or affiliate links);
