Your WordPress security starts within — with AAM. Take control of your WordPress website and solve security gaps today.

== Description ==

Most security plugins protect against external threats like malware or brute force attacks, but what about internal risks? AAM secures your site from within by preventing unauthorized access, privilege escalation, and broken access controls — the leading security vulnerabilities in WordPress.

* **Mitigate Broken Access Controls.** Ensure roles and permissions are correctly configured to prevent unauthorized actions.
* **Eliminate Excessive Privileges**. Identify overpowered users and tighten access to critical site functions.
* **Harden Content Moderation**. Restrict who can edit, publish, or delete sensitive content.
* **Enforce Security with Code**. Define access rules as JSON Access Policies, making them portable, auditable, and automated.
* **Empower Developers with AAM PHP Framework**. Build custom, secure access controls with a robust set of services and APIs.

= Key Features =

* **Security Audit** – Instantly detect misconfigurations, compromised accounts, and risky role assignments.
* **Granular Access Control** – Manage permissions for any role, user, or visitor with fine-tuned restrictions.
* **Content Security** – Lock down posts, pages, media, terms and custom content types or taxonomies.
* **Role & Capability Management** – Customize WordPress roles and define capabilities with precision.
* **Backend & Menu Control** – Restrict dashboard areas and tailor admin menus per user or role.
* **API & Endpoint Management** – Secure RESTful and XML-RPC APIs by controlling who can access them.
* **Passwordless & Secure Logins** – Offer password-free login while keeping authentication safe.
* **Developer-Ready** – Utilize a one-of-a-kind [AAM PHP Framework](https://aamportal.com/reference/php-framework/) for custom security solutions.
* **Ad-Free & Transparent** – No ads, no bloat—just powerful security tools.

= Built for Security-Conscious WordPress Users =

AAM is trusted by over 150,000 websites to deliver enterprise-grade security without complexity. Whether you’re a site admin, developer, or security professional, AAM gives you the tools to take control of WordPress security — your way.

* Most features are free. Advanced capabilities are available through [premium add-ons](https://aamportal.com/premium).
